# Norsk Gjeldsinformasjon technical reference

Norsk Gjeldsinformasjon AS is established by the financial institutions in
Norway, so that the industry has its own supplier of debt information. The
company has a license from the Ministry of Children and Families and is under
the supervision of The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (FSA). All
finance institutions that offer unsecured debt to consumers in Norway must
make their debt information available to us according to the Norwegian [debt
information law](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2017-06-16-47).

We have established a national infrastructure based on modern technology for
collection and distribution of debt information. Debt information is offered to
financial institutions and others who have the authority to obtain such
information. We offer a secure, stable and user-friendly solution.
Migration of the public documentation is currently a work in progress, the
documentation that is not yet migrated can be found [on confluence](https://norskgjeld.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GJEL/overview).
